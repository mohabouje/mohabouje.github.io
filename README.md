From a small town located in the south of Spain. Yet another *Spaniard* passionate about Software Engineering and Digital Signal Processing. Now-days, you may find me in the Paris area.

## About me

*”Mens sāna in corpore sānō”*

This Latin phrase fits me like a glove. 

From an early age, I was characterized by my seriousness and dedication to study and sports, obtaining good educational results and even playing in some   .I used to spend hours and hours exercising, trying to figure out how to improve my skills. I did athletics, rugby & football for years, a considerable amount of injuries and fractures can prove it.

I started coding when I got my first PC around 16. I remember my first C code; it still makes my hair stand on end. Ever since that moment, I knew I was born to be an engineer. Nowadays, I hold an MSc in Telecommunications Engineer from the University of Granada, Spain with a strong background in Software Engineering & Digital Signal Processing.

## Why Me?

If you are looking for someone passionate about technology with a strong background in algorithm design, optimizations, and digital signal processing, someone enthusiastic, responsible and wishing to develop his skill-set, *you just found him!*

I commonly understand and adapt myself to the local conditions and the working environment, independently but also effectively as
part of a team. I love solving complex problems and working alongside talented people, as someone said, if you’re the smartest
person in the room, you’re in the wrong place. 

I am continuously trying to figure out the best practices and useful design patterns to develop robust, maintainable and scalable solutions. *I am passionate about electronics and software engineering, and both are part of my daily hobbies*. 

**I am an active open-source contributor.** I have personally been involved very intimately in projects linked to cutting-edge technologies by designing robust algorithms related to generic fields like digital signal processing, positioning systems, big data analysis and machine learning.



```c++
template <typename Something>
void mohabouje::learn(const Something& something) noexcept {
    if (anyKnowledge(something)) {
        increaseKnowledge(something);
    } else {
        addKnowledge(something);
    }
}
```
