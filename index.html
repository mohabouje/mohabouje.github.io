            Yet another Spaniard passionate about Quantitative Finance,
            Algorithmic Trading, Software Engineering and Digital Signal
            Processing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hi there, It's Mo! 👋 I am an extrovert person, adventurous and
            wild (or what I think of myself); I like to spend time traveling
            and exercising, trying to figure out how to improve myself. I have
            been playing rugby & football for years, a significant number of
            injuries and fractures can prove it. Nowadays, I mostly spend few
            hours at the gym and do some kick-boxing.
            <br />
            <br />
            As cliché as it may sound, I do love music, I do really love
            music, any kind! I'm an active audio-effects creator; Sadly, I am
            not a musician but my background in physics and signal processing
            allows me to develop my own effects and share them with the
            community.

            <i>In every tech movie, there's a crazy hacker that can do
              everything, right? Those poor reproductions are based on me!
              Give me enough time and coffee, a high dose of caffeine, and I
              will try to figure out- or invent- anything.</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            I am a geek enthusiast! I started coding when I got my first PC in
            2006. I remember my first C code; it still makes my hair stand on
            end. Ever since that moment, I knew I was born to be an engineer.
            Nowadays, I hold a BSc & MSc in Telecommunications Engineer from
            the University of Granada, Spain.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are looking for someone passionate about technology with a
            solid background in algorithmic trading, algorithm design,
            optimizations, and digital signal processing, someone
            enthusiastic, responsible and wishing to develop his skill-set,
            you just found him!
            <br />
            <br />
            I commonly understand and adapt myself to the local conditions and
            the working environment, independently but also effectively as
            part of a team. I love solving complex problems and working
            alongside talented people, as someone said, if you’re the smartest
            person in the room, you’re in the wrong place.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am continuously trying to figure out the best practices and
            useful design patterns to develop robust, maintainable and
            scalable solutions. I am passionate about electronics and software
            engineering, and both are part of my daily hobbies.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am an active open-source contributor. I have personally been
            involved very intimately in projects linked to cutting-edge
            technologies by designing robust algorithms related to generic
            fields like digital signal processing, positioning systems, big
            data analysis, and machine learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            Have a look into my
            <a href="https://github.com/mohabouje">GitHub profile</a> to see
            some of my projects. Don't be shy, feel free to contact me if you
            have any questions.

            <h3>eDSP</h3>
            <p>
              eDSP (easy Digital Signal Processing) is a digital signal
              processing framework written in modern C++ that implements some
              of the common functions and algorithms frequently used in
              digital signal processing, audio engineering &
              telecommunications systems.
              <br />
              <br />
              It aims to provide efficient and streamlined base calculations
              while at the same time having a straightforward and easy-to-use
              interface similar to another numeric language like MATLAB. The
              library integrates C++ and Python interfaces and supports
              Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android.

            <h3>WinToast</h3>
            <p>
              WinToast is a light library written in C++ which brings a
              complete integration of the modern toast notifications of
              Windows 8 & Windows 10.
              <br />
              <br />
              Toast notifications allow your app to inform the users about
              relevant information and timely events that they should see and
              take action upon inside your apps, such as a new instant
              message, a new friend request, breaking news, or a calendar
              event.
